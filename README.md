# Library Management System

Add basic info about a book (title, author, pages, read status) using this simple library management system built with JavaScript. View and manage your books on a single page. Click "Add Book" to add a new one, "Library" to view/manage, "Delete" to remove, and "Read" to mark as read/unread. Customize and extend as needed.

## Improvements

- Make the styling more aesthetically pleasing
- Add a cancel button on the submit form
- Make it run on a live server, not just locally
- Refactor JS code (Make it more OOP-friendly)
- Add feature to edit existing book data, not just 'read' status

### What I learnt

- Implementing grid styling alongside JavaScript
- Managing an object array and syncing it with DOM elements
